The failing job is related to the "Pylint" workflow, which completed with an exit code 16. This indicates that Pylint encountered an issue during its run. Below is the relevant section of the workflow file and the logs:

### Solution
The exit code 16 from Pylint usually indicates a fatal error that prevents Pylint from completing its execution (e.g., a problem with the environment or the tool itself). Here are steps to debug and resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure Pylint Compatibility**:
   - Verify that the installed version of Pylint is compatible with Python 3.12.
   - You can specify a compatible version in the workflow to avoid issues with the latest releases:
     ```yaml
     - name: Install dependencies
       run: |
         pip install pylint==2.17.4
     ```

2. **Check for Environment Issues**:
   - Confirm that all dependencies required by Pylint and the project are correctly installed.
   - You can also add a step to list installed packages for debugging purposes:
     
     - name: List installed packages
       run: |
         pip list
     

3. **Verbose Output for Debugging**:
   - Enable verbose output to get more details from Pylint:
    
     - name: Analysing the code with pylint
       run: |
         pylint $(git ls-files '*.py') --disable=all --enable=C0114,C0115,C0116,C0301 -v
    

4. **Update Shared Workflow**:
   - If the shared workflow (`.github/workflows/shared_workflow.yml`) contains steps or configurations that might affect the Pylint job, review and ensure compatibility.

Apply these changes to the `.github/workflows/pylint.yml` and re-run the workflow to check if the issue is resolved.
